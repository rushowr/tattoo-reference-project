# The TATTOO Reference Project
## Description
  
  The _Tattoo Artist's Tome Of Reference_ or "TatTOo Reference" Project eventually intends to become a master archive of tattooing information for apprentice/beginner tattoo artists as well as veteran artists who wish to have a reference that can be trusted to have information that is verified and factual or has passed the community's requirements to become considered fact.
  
## Status
  I (@rushowr), have just created this repository because I had the idea to create the project, and I wanted to get this set up at the base level before I forgot it. The next steps will be to build out a structure in the repo for various stages of information being accepted, processed, reviewed, etc. Additionally, a website will be created that will act as the community's hub site, and a realtime communication setup such as a Discord server may be implemented as well. 
  
  Updates will be on the website and Discord once I've set those up, and of course those updates will be here in this README.md.

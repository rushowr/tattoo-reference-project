# The TATTOO Reference Project
## Description
  
  The _Tattoo Artist's Tome Of Reference_ or "TatTOo Reference" Project eventually intends to become a master archive of tattooing information for apprentice/beginner tattoo artists as well as veteran artists who wish to have a reference that can be trusted to have information that is verified and factual or has passed the community's requirements to become considered fact.
  
## Status
  AT THIS TIME THE PROJECT IS IN A SETUP PHASE, THERE IS NO INFORMATION OR MEDIA AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME
  
  Please note that initial information that I have to share is from my years of experiences tattooing with traditional coil and rotary machines. I have only obtained and begun using the modern "tattoo pens" which while they do use motors that have a spinning shaft, they operate on a principle using a "cam disk" (my own wording, actual correct technical name is unknown to me as of the writing of this document but I'll update it as soon as I know the correct term). Much of the information you need to tattoo with good or better results is the same or only needs some minor changes in order to be comparable to the traditional machine's methods. Part of this project is to note the differences between the three styles of machines and how technique and practices may be different, and then creating parallell information nodes that will be included in the archive with cross referencing and easy switching between the styles. 
  
## How you can help support the efforts of this project
### No donations requested, no subscriptions set up, because no content=no donations needed.

  As of this document's last edit, there is no patreon or paypal or any other method to contribute funds to the project. This is because I don't believe in asking for funds to support a project that is currently no more than my attempts to begin creating the community infrastructure that will be used to keep what I believe will become a large project in check or "wrangled" as I think of it. Once the project begins generating information to be consumed by the public, and likely when I have also added some contributing members (see upcoming section on that), we _might_ begin accepting donations and possibly even putting out some sort of bonus content (such as access to discussion meetings in the council's closed voice channel on discord, or early access to information, not sure what we'd set up but I'm just spitballing here). 

### Become a contributing member
  I imagine that if this project is to succeed, it will need more than just myself in the repo and on the website/discord/cans-on-a-string-with-stone-tablets-for-notes. I forsee that in addition to a community of readers/watchers, the following initial positions will need to be filled (no quantity requirements added just yet, only names and possibly summaries of positions named).:
  
   - Contributing Tattoo artists (licensed, legal): Much of the tattoo information out there is not really "verified fact" due to the closed nature of the industry and lack of open and available information that we can prove is in fact true and accepted by the professional tattooing industry. That is, unless we get some brave souls who wish to help reduce potential harm to tattoo clients by contributing information that they are willing to say is true, is safe, and is accepted/acceptable by/in the tattoo industry and specifically the industry in their area or a larger area. These artists will have had their license to practice their craft verified, and I intend to determine a solid way of storing a copy of at least the necessary identifying information regarding their tattoo license so that it's only accessible to authorized persons or systems, and in the most secure method possible. This is of course, early days, but there will be no license data stored anywhere in the project until the methods of:
      - encryption, 
      - storage, and 
      - retrieval/verification have ALL:
        - Passed the entire design, testing, bugfixing (cycle as needed, and review phases of the three phases: Init, Alpha, and Beta. 
        
   
      
  I (@rushowr), have just created this repository because I had the idea to create the project, and I wanted to get this set up at the base level before I forgot it. The next steps will be to build out a structure in the repo for various stages of information being accepted, processed, reviewed, etc. Additionally, a website will be created that will act as the community's hub site, and a realtime communication setup such as a Discord server may be implemented as well. 
  
  Updates will be on the website and Discord once I've set those up, and of course those updates will be here in this README.md.
